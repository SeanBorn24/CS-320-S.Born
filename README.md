**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I can ensure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure by designing test that tests specific functionalities and objects within the code. If all tests created pass then the code is functinal and secure. 
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Communication between the client and me as a developer is key. Making sure that I understand exactly what the client wants in terms of their programs look, functionality, and design is important. Making sure the expectations are clearly lined out and is signed off at each stage by the client. 
**How do I approach designing software?**
My approach is to follow the agile method in development to make sure that all necessary things are getting done. During development it is also important to use best practices when creating and even commenting within the code itself.
